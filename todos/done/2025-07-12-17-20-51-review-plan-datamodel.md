## Description
Review plan-datamodel.md to evaluate its fitness for purpose in a developer automation system and determine if it needs improvements, particularly regarding the new requirement for plan commands to transfer task lists to todo.md.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Read and analyze plan-datamodel.md structure and purpose
- [x] Evaluate automation components and developer workflow integration
- [x] Identify gaps: missing todo.md integration, limited automation, broad scope
- [x] Discuss command fitness and improvement needs with user
- [x] User decision: Delete plan-datamodel.md (redundant with plan-solution.md)
- [x] Delete claude/commands/plan-datamodel.md
- [x] Update README.md and project-description.md to remove plan-datamodel references
- [x] Update command counts from 16→15 and plan commands from 5→4
- [x] User test: Validate final decision addresses identified gaps

## Original Todo
review plan-datamodel.md with user

## Notes
- Command focuses on comprehensive data model planning (entities, performance, scalability)
- Good planning framework but lacks automation and practical outputs
- Missing todo.md integration required by new requirement
- Potential scope overlap with architecture planning commands
- No code generation or database tool integration
- Implementation phase only 20% - seems light for actual development work
- DECISION: Deleted as redundant with plan-solution.md which handles data modeling through research-driven approach
- Updated command count from 16→15 across all documentation
- plan-solution.md better approach for any technical challenge including data modeling
