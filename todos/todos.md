- add code templating system, global respoistory that defines the best practic approach for a given implementation of a technology, that has a header description and glob based file association. Then add a rule to claude.md that whenever context7 or other alternative to research best practices for a technology is used that part of the task must include adding a new template file to the global repository. The goal is that a tool research call should never happen more than once for a give technology as we should have a template file ready to use after the first instance. Also use claude.md to implement the glob based lookup when creating or editing files.
- create a more comprehensive test system, for each programming language we support we need a test codebase (search github for suitable existing codebases that are designed for testing for faults or use the tech we wish to test against). Then create a python test suite for checking our language specific scripts against the appropriate project. Where the languages arent universal i.e. windows and mac version we need to fold in a docker image process which will setup a suitable environment, im inclined to think this might be the best approach for all because I dont necesarily want to pollute my local machine with lots of language support i dont use.
- take the counter pose mcp /Users/adamjackson/LocalDev/counter-pose-mcp and add a global switch for critical thinking --critique, we also need to register counter-pose-mcp with an official package library.
- add playwright mcp support with e2e testing workflow
- add an init project workflow for using my starter project templates
- add a windows powershell verison of install script
- review the rules in the wip folder
- add browsertools mcp testing support
