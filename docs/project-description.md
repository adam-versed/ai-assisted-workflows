## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
Python 3.7+ required with comprehensive analysis dependencies:

**Security Analysis:**
- bandit (security linting)
- safety (vulnerability scanning) 
- semgrep (static analysis security scanner)

**Performance Analysis:**
- psutil (system and process utilities)
- memory-profiler (memory usage profiling)
- py-spy (Python profiler, Unix only)

**Code Quality Analysis:**
- flake8, pylint (code analysis and style)
- radon (complexity metrics)
- lizard (advanced complexity analysis)
- vulture (dead code detection)
- mccabe (complexity checking)

**Architecture Analysis:**
- pydeps (dependency analysis)
- networkx (graph analysis for dependencies)

### Setup Commands
```bash
# Install Python dependencies
cd claude/scripts/setup
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test installation
python test_install.py

# Run comprehensive analysis
python ../run_all_analysis.py
```

### MCP Tool Integration
Commands support optional enhancement flags:
