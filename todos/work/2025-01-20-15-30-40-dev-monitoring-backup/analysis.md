# Dev Monitoring Setup Analysis

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. Readonly Filesystem Error
**Problem**: Makefile trying to write to `/dev.log` (readonly system path)
**Evidence**: `tee: /dev.log: Read-only file system` in log.md:9,11,14,23,25,28
**Location**: Makefile:42,47,52 - using `/dev.log` instead of `./dev.log`
**Fix**: Change all references from `/dev.log` to `./dev.log` or `$(pwd)/dev.log`

### 2. Placeholder Commands in Generated Files
**Problem**: Generated Makefile contains placeholder "No start command defined" instead of actual commands
**Evidence**: log.md shows `[] [FRONTEND] No start command defined` repeatedly
**Location**: Makefile:39,44,49 - echo commands instead of real start commands
**Comparison**: Procfile:13-14 has correct commands `npm run dev` vs Makefile placeholders

### 3. Missing Backup Functionality
**Problem**: No backup of existing Procfile/Makefile before overwriting
**Evidence**: setup-dev-monitoring.md has no backup phase in workflow
**Need**: Add backup step before Phase 4 (Makefile) and Phase 5 (Procfile) generation

### 4. Script Generation Issues
**Root Cause**: The generation scripts are creating inconsistent outputs:
- Procfile generator creates proper commands: `cd apps/web && PORT=3000 npm run dev`
- Makefile generator creates placeholders: `echo "No start command defined"`

## Files Involved
- `/Users/adamjackson/LocalDev/ClaudeWorkflows/claude/commands/setup-dev-monitoring.md` - Main workflow
- Makefile generation script (needs location via glob)
- Procfile generation script (needs location via glob)
- Backup functionality needs to be added

## Required Changes
1. Add backup functionality before file generation
2. Fix Makefile log path from `/dev.log` to `./dev.log`  
3. Ensure Makefile generator uses actual commands like Procfile does
4. Update workflow documentation to include backup step
