## 🚀 Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Complete Project Setup with Continuous Improvement

```bash
# Plan UX and product requirements
/plan-ux-prd "Mobile app for GitHub task management with real-time updates"

# Initialize project with better-t-stack.dev CLI
/create-project mobile-task-app --from-todos ./todos/todos.md

# Setup continuous improvement system
/setup-continuous-improvement --threshold=0.85 --auto-refactor=simple

# Setup development monitoring
/setup-dev-monitoring

# Add quality gates
/add-code-precommit-checks
/add-code-posttooluse-quality-gates
```

### Example 2: Research and Implement with Quality Assurance

```bash
# Research and plan approaches with TDD mode
/plan-solution --tdd "Add real-time updates using WebSockets"

# Implement with continuous quality monitoring
/todo-orchestrate --seq

# System automatically:
# - Detects code duplications during implementation
# - Runs appropriate quality gates based on tech stack
# - Escalates complex issues to CTO agent
# - Generates refactoring suggestions and PRs
```

### Example 3: Existing Project Integration

```bash
# Analyze existing codebase
/analyze-architecture
/analyze-code-quality
/analyze-security

# Setup continuous improvement for existing project
/setup-continuous-improvement

# The system will:
# - Detect your current tech stack automatically
# - Configure appropriate similarity thresholds
# - Set up quality gates matching your build tools
# - Begin monitoring for code quality improvements
```
