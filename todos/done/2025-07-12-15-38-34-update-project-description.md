## Description
Claude Code Workflows is a comprehensive hybrid AI-automation system that combines Claude Code's reasoning capabilities with measurable Python analysis scripts. The project provides 18 structured workflow commands across security, performance, architecture, and quality analysis, featuring automated OWASP Top 10 security scanning, performance profiling, and code quality metrics.

The project has transformed from a simple GitHub Copilot migration concept into a production-ready workflow automation platform with 70+ Python scripts, cross-platform compatibility, and token-efficient command structure specifically designed for Claude Code's MCP tool ecosystem.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] **Replace project purpose and overview** (docs/project-description.md:1-6) - Update from migration concept to production workflow system description
- [x] **Update features section** (docs/project-description.md:8-11) - Replace generic features with specific capabilities: 18 commands, 23+ scripts, OWASP Top 10 coverage, hybrid AI+automation
- [x] **Replace TBD commands section** (docs/project-description.md:13-14) - Document all 18 commands organized by category (analyze, build, plan, fix) with descriptions
- [x] **Replace TBD structure section** (docs/project-description.md:16-17) - Document actual directory structure: claude/commands/, claude/scripts/analyze/, setup/, utils/
- [x] **Add technical specifications section** - Include Python dependencies, MCP tool integration (--c7, --seq, --magic), setup procedures
- [x] **Add automated analysis capabilities section** - Document security (OWASP), performance, architecture, code quality analysis scripts
- [x] **Update project status** (docs/project-description.md:19-20) - Change from "New project" to "Production Ready" with current capabilities
- [x] **Add test environment section** - Document test_codebase/ with vulnerable code for validation
- [x] **Automated test**: Verify updated project-description.md accurately reflects codebase structure
- [x] **User test**: Review updated project-description.md for accuracy and completeness

## Notes
- Completely rewrote project-description.md from outdated migration concept to accurate production system documentation
- Added comprehensive command catalog with all 18 workflow commands organized by category
- Documented automated analysis capabilities across security, performance, architecture, and code quality
- Included technical specifications with Python dependencies and MCP tool integration
- Added test environment documentation for validation workflows
- Automated verification identified and corrected script count inaccuracies (fixed 70+ to 23 scripts)
- Added missing lizard dependency to requirements.txt for complexity_lizard.py script

## Original Todo
Update the project-description.md - rerun its setup process as the project has changes significantly.
