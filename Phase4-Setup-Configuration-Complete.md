   ```

### Daily Usage Workflow

5. **Regular Status Monitoring**:

   ```bash
   # Weekly status check
   claude /continuous-improvement-status --history-days=7

   # Generate comprehensive metrics report
   python shared/lib/scripts/continuous-improvement/metrics/ci_metrics_collector.py report
   ```

6. **Review and Act on Recommendations**:

   ```bash
   # View pending recommendations
   python shared/lib/scripts/continuous-improvement/framework/ci_framework.py recommendations

   # Generate CI analysis
   python shared/lib/scripts/continuous-improvement/framework/ci_framework.py report
   ```

7. **Manual Analysis Triggers**:

   ```bash
   # Run symbol extraction
   python shared/lib/scripts/continuous-improvement/framework/ci_framework.py extract-symbols

   # Collect build metrics
   python shared/lib/scripts/continuous-improvement/metrics/ci_metrics_collector.py build
   ```

### Integration with Development Workflow

8. **Automatic Monitoring**:

   - Commit hooks automatically trigger analysis
   - GitHub Actions run continuous improvement checks
   - CTO agent escalation for complex refactoring decisions

9. **Quality Gates Integration**:

   ```bash
   # Check available quality gates
   python shared/lib/scripts/continuous-improvement/detection/quality_gate_detector.py detect

   # Run quality gates in production mode
   python shared/lib/scripts/continuous-improvement/detection/quality_gate_detector.py execute --mode production
   ```

### Troubleshooting and Maintenance

10. **Common Maintenance Tasks**:

    ```bash
    # Reinstall dependencies if needed
    pip install -r shared/lib/scripts/setup/requirements.txt

    # Update workflows only (preserve custom commands)
    ./claude-code/install.sh --update-workflows-only

    # Check MCP tool status
    claude mcp list | grep -E "(serena|sequential-thinking|grep)"
    ```
