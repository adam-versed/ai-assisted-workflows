# Plan Refactor v0.3
**Status:** Done
**Agent PID:** 48438

## Original Todo
review plan-refactor.md with the programmatic-prompt-commandfile.md approach and create a new version iterated to v0.3

## Description
Transform plan-refactor.md from v0.2 to v0.3 by adopting the programmatic-prompt-commandfile.md approach. This involves restructuring the verbose, paragraph-based workflow into concise numbered steps with clear phases, adding strategic STOP interactions for user input, implementing quality gates validation, and enhancing script integration with dynamic path discovery. The update maintains the comprehensive automated analysis capabilities while improving clarity, user interaction, and integration with the todos.md workflow.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Read current plan-refactor.md v0.2 (claude/commands/plan-refactor.md)
- [x] Create new v0.3 structure with programmatic approach
- [x] Enhance script integration with glob-based discovery
- [x] Add todos.md integration workflow
- [x] Automated test: Verify new structure follows programmatic-prompt-commandfile.md standards
- [x] User test: Confirm v0.3 maintains refactoring analysis capabilities while improving usability
