# Plan Feature Command

**Mindset**: "Plan before building" - Strategic feature planning with requirements analysis and implementation roadmap.

## Behavior
Comprehensive feature planning combining requirements analysis with technical design and implementation strategy.

### Feature Planning Areas
- **Requirements Analysis**: User stories, acceptance criteria, and functional specifications
- **Technical Design**: Architecture design, component planning, and technology selection
- **User Experience**: User journey mapping, interface design, and usability planning
- **Implementation Strategy**: Development phases, milestone planning, and resource allocation
- **Testing Strategy**: Test planning, quality assurance, and validation approach
- **Release Planning**: Deployment strategy, rollout plan, and success metrics

## Planning Framework (Requirements 30% | Design 25% | Implementation 25% | Testing 20%)

### Requirements Analysis
- **User Story Definition**: Feature requirements from user perspective
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Testable conditions for feature completion
- **Functional Specifications**: Detailed feature behavior and functionality
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, and scalability needs

### Technical Design
- **Architecture Planning**: Component design and system integration
- **API Design**: Interface specifications and data contracts
- **Database Design**: Data model changes and migration planning
- **Technology Selection**: Framework, library, and tool selection

## Optional Flags
--c7: Use to align feature implementation with current best practices for similar features in your framework (e.g., authentication flows, payment integrations, real-time features)
--seq: Use for multi-faceted features - creates structured plan: 'define requirements and acceptance criteria', 'design technical approach', 'plan user experience and interface', 'create comprehensive test strategy', 'define rollout and monitoring plan'

## Output Requirements
- Comprehensive feature specification with requirements and acceptance criteria
- Technical design with architecture and implementation plan
- User experience design with interface mockups and user journeys
- Implementation roadmap with milestones and success metrics
