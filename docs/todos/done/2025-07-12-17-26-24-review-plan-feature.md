## Description
Review plan-feature.md to evaluate its fitness and unique value in the developer automation system, particularly given significant overlaps with plan-solution.md and plan-ux-prd.md, plus missing todo.md integration.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Read and analyze plan-feature.md structure and purpose
- [x] Evaluate overlap with other planning commands (plan-solution, plan-ux-prd)
- [x] Identify missing automation and todo.md integration
- [x] Discuss command redundancy and unique value with user
- [x] User decision: Delete plan-feature.md (redundant with plan-solution.md and plan-ux-prd.md)
- [x] Delete claude/commands/plan-feature.md
- [x] Update README.md and project-description.md to remove plan-feature references
- [x] Update command counts from 15→14 and plan commands from 4→3
- [x] User test: Validate final decision addresses overlap concerns

## Original Todo
review plan-feature.md with user

## Notes
- Command focuses on comprehensive feature planning (requirements, design, implementation)
- Significant overlap with plan-solution.md (technical aspects) and plan-ux-prd.md (UX aspects)
- Lacks automation components unlike other planning commands
- Missing todo.md integration required by new requirement
- Sits uncomfortably between more specialized commands
- Provides limited unique value that couldn't be achieved by combining specialized commands
- DECISION: Deleted as redundant - plan-solution.md + plan-ux-prd.md cover all use cases better
- Updated command count from 15→14 across all documentation
- Streamlined planning commands to focus on specialized, non-overlapping tools
