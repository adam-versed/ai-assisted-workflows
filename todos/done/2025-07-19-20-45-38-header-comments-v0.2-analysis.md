## Analysis Summary

Based on my research of the claude/commands/ directory, here are my findings:

### **Command Files Found**
Total of **13 command files**:

1. `analyze-architecture.md`
2. `analyze-code-quality.md` 
3. `analyze-performance.md`
4. `analyze-root-cause.md`
5. `analyze-security.md`
6. `analyze-ux.md`
7. `fix-bug.md`
8. `fix-performance.md`
9. `fix-test.md`
10. `plan-refactor.md`
11. `plan-solution.md`
12. `plan-ux-prd.md`
13. `setup-dev-monitoring.md`

### **Current Header Structure Examples**

**Example 1: Simple Header (analyze-architecture.md)**
```markdown
# Architecture Review Command

**Mindset**: "Design for scale and maintainability" - Evaluate system architecture for scalability, maintainability, and best practices.
```

**Example 2: Versioned Header (plan-solution.md)**
```markdown
# plan-solution v0.7

**Purpose**: Research-driven technical challenge solving with systematic analysis and implementation planning.
```

**Example 3: Versioned Header (setup-dev-monitoring.md)**
```markdown
# Setup Development Monitoring v1.0

**Purpose**: Establish comprehensive development monitoring infrastructure for any project structure through LLM-driven analysis and cross-platform automation.
```

### **Existing Versioning Patterns**

**Two Distinct Versioning Approaches Found:**

1. **Inline Versioning**: `# [command-name] v[version]` (plan-solution v0.7, setup-dev-monitoring v1.0)
2. **No Versioning**: Simple command titles without version numbers (majority of files)

**Versioning Details:**
- Only 2 out of 13 files currently have version numbers
- Format: `v[major].[minor]` (v0.7, v1.0)
- No semantic versioning patch numbers observed

### **Overall Structure Patterns**

**Consistent Header Elements:**
1. **H1 Title**: Always starts with `# [Command Name]`
2. **Purpose/Mindset Statement**: Either `**Purpose**:` or `**Mindset**:` directly after title
3. **Behavior Section**: Most files have `## Behavior` section early in document

**Common Structural Elements:**
- `## Optional Flags` (with --c7, --seq patterns)
- `## Output Requirements` 
- `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder at end of many files
- Script integration sections with dynamic path resolution
- Detailed workflow phases and processes

**Content Length Variation:**
- Range from ~50 lines (analyze-code-quality.md) to ~470 lines (plan-ux-prd.md)
- Most files are comprehensive with detailed workflow specifications

### **Recommendations for Header Consistency**

To maintain consistency while adding appropriate headers, I recommend:

1. **Preserve existing versioned files** (plan-solution v0.7, setup-dev-monitoring v1.0)
2. **Add version numbers** to unversioned files starting with v1.0
3. **Standardize purpose statements** using `**Purpose**:` format
4. **Maintain current H1 title format**: `# [Command Name] v[version]`

The files are well-structured professional command specifications with clear workflows, and any header additions should maintain this high-quality, systematic approach.

Based on my research of the plan-solution.md file and related files, here's what I found regarding the header format specifications for command files:

## Header Format Analysis from plan-solution.md

### 1. **Header Format Requirements**
From examining the plan-solution.md file (which serves as both specification and example), the header format should be:

```markdown
# [command-name] v[version]
```

**Example from plan-solution.md:**
```markdown
# plan-solution v0.7
```

### 2. **Versioning Standard**
- The file shows `v0.7` as the current version format
- The task mentions "v0.2 versioning standard", which suggests this is the target version format
- Version format appears to be: `v[major].[minor]`

### 3. **What "Label" Means**
In the context of command files, "label" appears to refer to the **version identifier** (e.g., `v0.2`). This is the versioning label that should be included in the header.

### 4. **Specific Requirements Found**
From the programmatic-prompt-commandfile.md rules, the header structure should include:

```markdown
# [Command Name] (`[command]`)

**Purpose**: [One-line description]
**Usage**: `claude /[command] [flags]`
```

However, the plan-solution.md file shows a simpler versioned format:
```markdown
# plan-solution v0.7

**Purpose**: Research-driven technical challenge solving with systematic analysis and implementation planning.
```

### 5. **Current State vs. Required State**
- **Current files** mostly use: `# [Command Name] Command` (no versioning)
- **plan-solution.md** uses: `# plan-solution v0.7` (versioned)
- **Required format** (based on task): `# [command-name] v0.2` (standardized to v0.2)

### 6. **Header Comment Requirement**
The task specifically mentions "header comments as per the plan-solution.md file", which appears to refer to:
- Including version numbers in headers
- Following the concise format shown in plan-solution.md
- Standardizing all command files to use the v0.2 version label

## Summary
The plan-solution.md file specifies that command file headers should:
1. Include the command name in lowercase-hyphenated format
2. Include a version number (target: v0.2)
3. Follow the format: `# [command-name] v[version]`
4. Be followed by a **Purpose** line explaining the command's function

The task is asking to standardize all command files to use this header format with the v0.2 label.
