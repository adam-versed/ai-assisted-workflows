            This analysis was performed automatically using the simplified orchestration bridge that delegates to Claude Code's todo-orchestrate workflow for automatic fixes.

            - ‚úÖ **Automatic fixes**: Handled via \`claude /todo-orchestrate\`
            - üìù **Manual reviews**: Created as GitHub issues with technical-debt labels
            - ‚è≠Ô∏è **Low-risk duplicates**: Automatically skipped based on CTO decision matrix
