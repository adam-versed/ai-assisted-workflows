# Dev Monitoring Setup Backup Enhancement
**Status:** InProgress
**Agent PID:** 12492

## Original Todo
dev monitoring setup should backup existing proc/make files (or offer to overwrite), still issues with process

## Description
Enhance the dev monitoring setup workflow to prompt users when existing Procfile/Makefile are found, offering choice to either overwrite or backup existing files, plus fix the readonly filesystem issue with log paths and ensure generated files contain actual start commands.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Add file existence check and user prompt phase to setup-dev-monitoring.md before file generation
- [x] Locate and fix Makefile generation script to use ./dev.log instead of /dev.log  
- [x] Ensure Makefile generation script uses actual commands (not placeholders)
- [x] Create backup utility that asks "overwrite existing files or backup?" when files exist
- [x] Test the enhanced workflow to verify user choice handling and correct file generation
