## Description
Remove all references to Puppeteer from the Claude Code Workflows framework. The codebase currently contains Puppeteer references in installation scripts, documentation, and setup processes, but no actual code implementation. The goal is to completely eliminate Puppeteer from the framework to avoid any browser automation dependencies and ensure MCP tools include sequential-thinking and context7.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Update MCP server array to include context7 and remove puppeteer (install.sh:522)
- [x] Remove entire Puppeteer installation block from install.sh (install.sh:662-670)
- [x] Add context7 installation block after sequential-thinking installation (install.sh:661)
- [x] Update manual install instructions to include context7 and remove puppeteer (install.sh:674-675)
- [x] Update MCP server array in uninstall.sh to include context7 and remove puppeteer
- [x] Remove Puppeteer tool description from README.md (README.md:128)
- [x] Remove browser tools benefit description from README.md (README.md:135)
- [x] Automated test: Verify bash arrays are syntactically correct after changes
- [x] Automated test: Test installation script runs successfully with sequential-thinking and context7
- [x] Automated test: Verify uninstall script targets both sequential-thinking and context7
- [x] User test: Run install.sh and confirm both sequential-thinking and context7 MCP tools are installed
- [x] User test: Run uninstall.sh and confirm it cleanly removes both expected tools
- [x] User test: Verify README accurately reflects available MCP tools (sequential-thinking and context7)

## Original Todo
- ensure puppeter is not used anywhere in the framework
