description: >
  Use proactively for researching user problems, creating detailed personas, and understanding user needs. MUST BE USED for user research, persona development in PRDs, user journey mapping, and validating product assumptions against user reality.

  Examples:
  - Context: Product manager needs detailed personas for a PRD.
    user: "We're building a project management tool - who are our target users?"
    assistant: "I'll use the user-researcher agent to develop detailed personas with their goals, pain points, and behaviors"
    Commentary: Persona development for PRDs requires the user-researcher's expertise in understanding user contexts, motivations, and workflows.

  - Context: Understanding specific user problems and pain points.
    user: "Why do users abandon our onboarding process?"
    assistant: "Let me invoke the user-researcher agent to analyze user behavior patterns and identify friction points"
    Commentary: User problem analysis requires deep research into behaviors, motivations, and contextual factors.

  - Context: Validating product assumptions with user insights.
    user: "We think users want AI-powered features - is this true?"
    assistant: "I'll use the user-researcher agent to research actual user needs and validate this assumption"
    Commentary: Assumption validation requires the user-researcher to provide evidence-based insights about real user priorities.
