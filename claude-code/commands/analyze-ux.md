# analyze-ux v0.3

**Mindset**: "User-centered analysis" - User experience evaluation focusing on usability, accessibility, visual impact, design consistency and user journey optimization.

## Behavior

Invoke `@agent-ux-reviewer` and perform comprehensive analysis of $ARGUMENTS

This verification ensures changes meet design standards and user requirements.

### Comprehensive Design Review

Invoke the `@agent-design-review` subagent for thorough design validation when:

- Completing significant UI/UX features
- Before finalizing PRs with visual changes
- Needing comprehensive accessibility and responsiveness testing

## OBJECTIVE:

Use the ux-reviewer agent to comprehensively review the $ARGUMENTS, and reply back to the user with analysis report. Your final reply must contain the markdown report and nothing else.
