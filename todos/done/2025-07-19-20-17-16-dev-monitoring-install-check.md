# Dev-monitoring Scripts Install Check
**Status:** Done
**Agent PID:** 40202

## Original Todo
check that the dev-monitoring scripts get copied to target as part of the install.sh script runs

## Description
Verify that the install.sh script correctly copies all dev-monitoring scripts and utilities to target installations, ensuring the complete monitoring infrastructure is available after installation.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Create test script to verify dev-monitoring files are copied during install (claude/scripts/test/test_dev_monitoring_install.py)
- [x] Test script verifies presence of core dev-monitoring scripts in target directory
- [x] Test script verifies presence of monitoring utility scripts  
- [x] Automated test: Run test script against a mock installation
- [x] User test: Run install.sh and manually verify dev-monitoring scripts are present
