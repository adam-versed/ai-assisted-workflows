# Analysis for setup-dev-monitoring Command

## Research Agent Analysis of setup_make_dev.py Script

### Core Architecture & Purpose

The `setup_make_dev.py` script is designed to create a **standardized, make-based development workflow** for Turborepo monorepos with the following key principles:

1. **User-controlled service management** - Claude should never start/stop development services
2. **Unified logging system** - All services log to a single `dev.log` file with timestamps and service prefixes
3. **Automated dependency checking and installation**
4. **Safety-first approach** - Explicit guards against AI agents making destructive changes

### Key Components & Functionality

#### 1. Project Detection System (Lines 41-105)
```python
def detect_project_structure(self) -> bool:
    # Detects Turborepo projects by checking for:
    # - turbo.json (required)
    # - apps/web/package.json with Next.js dependencies  
    # - apps/native/package.json with Expo/React Native
    # - Convex backend configuration and generated files
```

**Key Pattern**: Multi-layered validation that not only checks for file existence but also validates contents (e.g., checking for "next" in package.json dependencies).

#### 2. Dependency Management (Lines 107-152, 211-262)
```python
def check_dependencies(self) -> Dict[str, bool]:
    # Required: make, node, npm
    # Optional: watchexec, shoreman
    # Platform-specific installation via brew (macOS), apt/yum (Linux)
```

**Key Pattern**: Distinguishes between required and optional dependencies, with graceful degradation and helpful installation instructions.

#### 3. Convex Backend Validation (Lines 154-184)
```python
def check_convex_setup(self) -> bool:
    # Validates that Convex is properly configured:
    # - convex/_generated/ folder exists and has content
    # - convex/schema.ts exists
    # - Supports both standard and workspace-based setups
```

**Key Pattern**: Goes beyond simple file existence to validate that generated files are populated, preventing setup issues.

#### 4. Makefile Generation (Lines 264-365)
The generated Makefile includes:

- **Critical safety comments** warning Claude never to run `make dev`
- **User-only commands**: `dev`, `stop` 
- **Claude-accessible commands**: `tail-log`, `status`, `lint`, `test`, `format`, `clean`
- **Helpful documentation** embedded directly in the Makefile

**Key Pattern**: The Makefile acts as both a functional tool and documentation system, with embedded warnings and usage instructions.

#### 5. Procfile Generation (Lines 367-405)
```bash
# Example generated service definitions:
web: cd apps/web && PORT=3000 npm run dev 2>&1 | while IFS= read -r line; do echo "[$(date '+%H:%M:%S')] [WEB] $line"; done | tee -a ../../dev.log

native: cd apps/native && npx expo start --clear 2>&1 | while IFS= read -r line; do echo "[$(date '+%H:%M:%S')] [NATIVE] $line"; done | tee -a ../../dev.log

backend: npx convex dev 2>&1 | while IFS= read -r line; do echo "[$(date '+%H:%M:%S')] [BACKEND] $line"; done | tee -a dev.log
```

**Key Pattern**: Each service pipes output through a timestamp logger that adds service prefixes and writes to unified log file.

#### 6. Unified Logging System
The logging approach uses:
- **Timestamped entries**: `[HH:MM:SS]` format
- **Service prefixes**: `[WEB]`, `[NATIVE]`, `[BACKEND]`
- **Central log file**: `./dev.log` in project root
- **Fresh logs**: Cleaned on each restart
- **Real-time access**: via `make tail-log`

**Key Pattern**: This provides Claude with complete context about system state without requiring direct service access.

#### 7. CLAUDE.md Integration (Lines 439-503)
Automatically updates project documentation with:
- **Service management restrictions** for AI agents
- **Available commands** with clear usage guidelines  
- **Log file locations** and access patterns
- **Workflow integration** instructions

### Development Philosophy & Approach

#### 1. Safety-First Design
- Multiple layers of validation before making changes
- Explicit warnings embedded in generated files
- Clear separation between user-only and AI-accessible commands
- Graceful failure modes with helpful error messages

#### 2. Context-Aware Development
- Unified logging provides complete system visibility
- Log aggregation from multiple services in single location
- Timestamped entries enable debugging across service boundaries
- Real-time log access via standardized commands

#### 3. Developer Experience Focus
- Automatic dependency detection and installation
- Platform-specific installation commands
- Comprehensive validation and testing
- Self-documenting generated files

#### 4. AI Agent Integration
- Clear command separation (user vs AI accessible)
- Standardized log access patterns
- Embedded documentation and warnings
- Context preservation across development sessions

## Research Agent Analysis of Programmatic-Prompt-Commandfile Approach

### Core Structure

The approach follows these key principles:

**Core Approach**: "Concise precision, complete structure" - minimal words to express complete phase workflows with numbered steps, code snippets, and user interactions.

**Mandatory Sections**:
- **Command Header**: Purpose and usage instructions
- **Phase Structure**: Clear workflow progression with numbered steps

**Optional Sections** (include only when needed):
- **STOP Interactions**: User input points
- **Bash Commands**: System operations
- **Tool Usage Definition**: External tool specifications
- **Structured Outputs**: Consistent formatting
- **Git Usage**: Repository operations
- **Quality Gates**: Code quality/testing requirements

### Command File Patterns from Examples

**Header Structure**:
```markdown
# [Command Name] v[version]

**Purpose**: [One-line description]
```

**Phase-Based Workflow**:
- Each phase has a clear purpose and numbered steps
- Integration of automated scripts with dynamic path discovery
- User interaction points marked with **STOP** â†’
- Clear bash command blocks with expected outputs

**Script Integration Pattern**:
```bash
# Script Location Process:
1. Use Glob tool to find script paths: `**/scripts/analyze/[category]/*.py`
2. Verify script availability and determine correct absolute paths
3. Execute scripts with resolved paths
```

### How Command Files Use This Approach

**setup-make-dev.md**: 
- 8 phases from detection through validation
- Integrates with project structure analysis
- Creates multiple files (Makefile, Procfile, CLAUDE.md)
- Heavy use of STOP interactions for user confirmation

**analyze-security.md**:
- Combines automated script execution with LLM analysis
- Uses autonomous gap assessment and complementary actions
- Has verbose mode flag for detailed vs. summary outputs
- Integrates with existing security analysis scripts

**plan-solution.v0.7.md**:
- Research-driven with web search integration
- 3-solution comparative analysis structure
- Task transfer to todos.md as final phase
- Clear flag definitions (--c7, --critique, --seq)

### Key Patterns for setup-dev-monitoring

Based on the setup_make_dev.py script analysis and the task requirements, the new command should:

**Break the Python script into smaller focused scripts**:
- `detect_project_structure.py` - Project detection and analysis
- `check_dependencies.py` - Dependency verification and installation
- `generate_monitoring_files.py` - Create monitoring-specific files

**LLM Analysis and Awareness Phase**:
- Analyze monorepo structure and identify all apps/packages
- Determine appropriate labels and service names
- Assess monitoring requirements based on detected technologies

**Argument-Driven File Generation**:
- Pass analyzed project structure to file generation scripts
- Create monitoring-enhanced Makefile with additional targets
- Generate monitoring-specific Procfile configurations
- Update/create .claude/CLAUDE.md with monitoring instructions

**Additional Considerations** (from setup_make_dev.py):
- Port conflict detection and resolution
- Convex backend detection and configuration
- Service health checking and monitoring
- Log aggregation and monitoring integration
- Performance monitoring hooks
- Error tracking integration

The command file should follow the programmatic-prompt-commandfile approach with phases for detection, analysis, configuration, generation, and validation, incorporating both automated script execution and LLM contextual analysis for intelligent monitoring setup.
