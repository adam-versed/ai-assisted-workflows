⏺ 🔒 Security Analysis Report - /test_codebase

Security Score: 0/100 ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES DETECTED

Executive Summary

Multiple critical security vulnerabilities identified requiring immediate
remediation. The application contains hardcoded secrets, injection vulnerabilities,
and authentication failures.

🚨 Critical Findings

[CRITICAL] Code injection vulnerability - app.py:33[CRITICAL] Hardcoded JWT secret -
app.py:47[CRITICAL] Hardcoded API key - app.py:11[CRITICAL] Hardcoded database
password - app.py:10[CRITICAL] Hardcoded AWS access key - app.py:12

⚠️ High Risk Findings

[HIGH] SQL injection vulnerability - app.py:21[HIGH] SSL verification disabled -
app.py:43[HIGH] Database connection string exposed - app.py:17[HIGH] Missing
authorization checks - multiple functions[HIGH] Missing CSRF protection -
app.py:17[HIGH] Weak password policy - app.py:17

🔍 Coverage Gap Analysis

Script Detection vs. Codebase Reality:

| Vulnerability Type | Script Detection | 🧠 LLM Analysis | Gap Assessment
|
|--------------------|------------------|------------------------|-------------------
-----------------|
| Code Injection | ❌ Not detected | ✅ Found eval() usage | Scripts missed
critical RCE vector |
| SQL Injection | ❌ Not detected | ✅ Found f-string query | Pattern matching
insufficient |
| SSL Bypass | ❌ Not detected | ✅ Found verify=False | Missing from
vulnerability scan |
| Secrets Detection | ✅ 6 findings | ✅ Confirmed all | Good coverage
|
| Auth Failures | ✅ 8 findings | ✅ Enhanced analysis | Good coverage
|

🛠️ Priority Actions

1. Immediate: Remove eval() function from get_user_data() method
2. Immediate: Move all hardcoded secrets to environment variables
3. Immediate: Implement parameterized queries for database operations
4. High: Enable SSL verification for all external requests
5. High: Add proper authorization checks to all endpoints

📋 Remediation Roadmap

Phase 1 (Critical - 24 hours)

- Replace eval() with safe JSON parsing
- Externalize all secrets to environment variables
- Fix SQL injection with prepared statements

Phase 2 (High - 1 week)

- Implement proper authorization middleware
- Add CSRF protection
- Enable SSL verification
- Strengthen password policies

Phase 3 (Medium - 2 weeks)

- Add comprehensive input validation
- Implement security logging
- Add rate limiting
