# Build Prototype Command

**Mindset**: "Build fast, iterate quickly" - Create rapid prototypes using existing libraries and frameworks.

## Behavior
Rapid prototype development using existing component libraries, frameworks, and mock data for quick iteration and feedback cycles.

### Rapid Development Strategy
- **Leverage Existing Libraries**: Use established component libraries and frameworks
- **Mock Data Integration**: Use realistic mock data and external service simulation
- **Focus on Core Functionality**: Demonstrate key features without full production setup
- **Minimal Configuration**: Reduce setup complexity for faster iteration
- **Quick Feedback Cycles**: Enable rapid testing and user feedback

## Prototyping Process
1. **Identify Core Features**: Focus on essential functionality for demonstration
2. **Select Libraries**: Choose appropriate existing libraries and frameworks
3. **Create Mock Layer**: Implement data mocking and service simulation
4. **Build Incrementally**: Develop feature by feature with working demonstrations
5. **Test and Iterate**: Gather feedback and refine rapidly

## Optional Flags
--magic: Use to quickly generate UI components and fetch company logos for your prototype - saves time on visual design and branding elements
--c7: Use to discover the best rapid prototyping tools and libraries for your tech stack (e.g., Next.js starter templates, React component libraries, Vue CLI presets)

## Prototype Focus
Core Functionality, User Experience, Technical Feasibility, Integration Points

## Output Requirements
- Working prototype demonstrating core functionality
- Mock data integration for realistic user experience
- Minimal setup requirements for easy testing
- Documentation for prototype limitations and next steps
