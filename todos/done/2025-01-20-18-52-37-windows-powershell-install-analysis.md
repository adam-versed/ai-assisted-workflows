Based on my analysis of the install.sh script and related files, here's a comprehensive breakdown:

## Analysis of install.sh Script

### 1. What It Does and How It Works

The install.sh script is a comprehensive installer for the Claude Code Workflows system. It sets up a complete workflow management system with commands, scripts, and dependencies. The script:

- **Creates a `.claude/` directory** structure in a specified location (current directory, user home, or custom path)
- **Installs Python dependencies** for code analysis tools (security, performance, architecture analysis)
- **Sets up MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools** for enhanced Claude functionality
- **Copies workflow files** including commands, scripts, rules, and templates
- **Handles existing installations** with merge, update, or fresh install options

### 2. Directories and Files Created/Modified

**Main Installation Structure:**
- `/TARGET_PATH/.claude/` - Main installation directory containing:
  - `commands/` - 12 markdown command files (analyze-security, plan-solution, fix-bug, etc.)
  - `scripts/` - Python analysis scripts organized by function:
    - `analyze/` - Security, performance, architecture, code quality analysis tools
    - `setup/` - Installation and dependency management
    - `utils/` - Cross-platform utilities and helpers
  - `rules/` - Workflow rule files (prototype.md, tdd.md, quality-gates.md, etc.)
  - `templates/` - Task templates
  - `claude.md` - Configuration file for Claude enhanced workflows
  - `CLAUDE.md` - Documentation file
  - `installation-log.txt` - Tracks installed components for uninstall

**Backup System:**
- Creates automatic backups with timestamps: `.claude.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`

### 3. Dependencies and Prerequisites Checked

**System Requirements:**
- **Python 3.7+** - Verified with version check
- **pip3** - Package manager availability
- **Node.js** - Required for MCP tools (can be skipped with `--skip-mcp`)
- **Claude CLI** - Required for MCP integration (can be skipped with `--skip-mcp`)
- **Internet connectivity** - For downloading dependencies

**Python Dependencies Installed (from requirements.txt):**
- **Security Analysis:** bandit, safety, semgrep
- **Performance Analysis:** psutil, memory-profiler, py-spy
- **Code Quality:** flake8, pylint, radon, lizard, vulture, mccabe
- **Architecture Analysis:** pydeps, networkx
- **Development Tools:** pytest, black, isort

**MCP Tools:**
- `sequential-thinking` - For complex analysis workflows
- `context7` - For framework documentation

### 4. Error Handling and User Prompts

**Robust Error Handling:**
- **Logging system** with timestamped entries to `/tmp/claude-workflows-install.log`
- **Trap-based cleanup** on script exit
- **Platform detection** with unsupported platform warnings
- **Dependency validation** with clear error messages
- **Installation verification** with rollback capabilities

**User Interaction:**
- **Installation conflict resolution** with 4 options:
  1. Fresh install (replace existing)
  2. Merge with existing (preserve customizations)
  3. Update workflows only (preserve custom commands)
  4. Cancel installation
- **Confirmation prompts** for dependency installation
- **Automatic backup creation** before any destructive operations

### 5. Overall Structure and Flow

**Installation Process:**
1. **Argument parsing** - Handle target path, flags, and options
2. **Environment validation** - Check platform, Python, Node.js, Claude CLI
3. **Directory setup** - Create installation directory with conflict handling
4. **File operations** - Copy workflow files with merge/update logic
5. **Dependency installation** - Install Python packages and MCP tools
6. **Verification** - Test installation completeness
7. **Completion report** - Show available commands and usage

**Key Features:**
- **Flexible installation targets** (current directory, user home, custom path)
- **Non-destructive operations** with automatic backups
- **Selective installation** with skip flags for MCP and Python dependencies
- **Dry-run mode** for preview without changes
- **Comprehensive logging** for troubleshooting
- **Cross-platform support** (macOS, Linux, Windows)

**Command-line Options:**
- `TARGET_PATH` - Installation location
- `--dry-run` - Preview changes without execution
- `--skip-mcp` - Skip MCP tools installation
- `--skip-python` - Skip Python dependencies
- `--verbose` - Enhanced logging output
- `--help` - Usage information

The script is well-structured with clear separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and user-friendly operation modes. It provides a complete workflow management system while preserving user customizations and providing safe installation/update procedures.

## Claude Workflows Directory Structure Overview

### Main Structure

The Claude workflows system is organized under `/Users/adamjackson/LocalDev/ClaudeWorkflows/claude/` with the following key components:

- `analyze-performance.md` - Performance bottleneck identification
- `analyze-root-cause.md` - Bug investigation and root cause analysis
- `analyze-code-quality.md` - Code quality metrics and technical debt
- `analyze-ux.md` - User experience evaluation

**Planning Commands:**
- `plan-solution.md` - Technical challenge solving approach
- `plan-refactor.md` - Refactoring strategy with technical debt assessment
- `plan-ux-prd.md` - UX-focused product requirements planning
