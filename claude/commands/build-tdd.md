# Build TDD Command

**Mindset**: "Test first, code second" - Test-driven development with comprehensive test coverage and quality assurance.

## Behavior
Test-driven development implementation with systematic test creation, code implementation, and refactoring cycles.

### TDD Development Process
- **Red Phase**: Write failing tests that define desired functionality
- **Green Phase**: Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- **Refactor Phase**: Improve code quality while maintaining test coverage
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and acceptance testing
- **Quality Assurance**: Continuous validation and code quality improvement
- **Documentation**: Test documentation and behavior specification

## TDD Framework (Test Design 30% | Implementation 40% | Refactoring 20% | Validation 10%)

### Test Design
- **Requirements Analysis**: Convert requirements into testable specifications
- **Test Case Design**: Unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance criteria
- **Test Data**: Mock data, fixtures, and test environment setup
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Boundary conditions and error scenario testing

### Implementation
- **Minimal Implementation**: Code just enough to pass tests
- **Incremental Development**: Small, focused changes with immediate validation
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and validation pipeline
- **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, maintainable implementation

## Optional Flags
--c7: Use to ensure your testing approach follows current TDD patterns for your framework (e.g., Jest best practices for React, pytest patterns for Python, Go testing conventions)
--seq: Use to structure TDD workflow for complex features - breaks down into 'write failing test', 'implement minimal code', 'refactor for quality', 'add edge cases', 'document behavior'

## Output Requirements
- Comprehensive test suite with high coverage
- Clean, well-tested implementation
- Refactored code with improved design
- Test documentation and behavior specifications
