# Plan-solution.v0.7.md Review
**Status:** Done
**Agent PID:** 40202

## Original Todo
review plan-solution.v0.7.md file

## Description
Improve plan-solution.v0.7.md by enhancing the context gathering section with more detail and making the architecture analysis phase conditional (only applicable when analyzing a specific current codebase, skippable for general planning questions).

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Read original plan-solution.md to compare context gathering approaches
- [x] Enhance Phase 1 (Context Gathering) with more detailed requirements
- [x] Add conditional logic to Phase 2 (System Analysis) to skip when not analyzing current codebase
- [x] Update workflow to properly handle both current codebase analysis and general planning scenarios
- [x] Automated test: Verify improved workflow structure maintains versioning format
- [x] User test: Confirm enhanced context gathering and conditional analysis work as expected
