**Agent PID:** 738

## Description
Create a comprehensive README.md that showcases Claude Code Workflows as a production-ready hybrid AI-automation system. The README will demonstrate how the project enhances Claude Code with 18 specialized workflow commands and 23 Python analysis scripts, providing measurable automation across security (OWASP Top 10), performance, architecture, and quality analysis.

Key Sections: Project overview highlighting unique value (hybrid AI + automation), prerequisites (Python 3.7+, Claude CLI, Node.js), flexible installation options via install.sh script, practical usage examples with real commands, complete command catalog organized by category, and getting started guide with immediate next steps for new users.

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] **Create README.md with hero section** (README.md:1-25) - Compelling project introduction with key metrics and value proposition
- [ ] **Add quick start section** (README.md:26-60) - 60-second installation and first command demo using test_codebase vulnerability detection
- [ ] **Document prerequisites and installation** (README.md:61-100) - Requirements, install.sh usage examples, and troubleshooting
- [ ] **Create command reference section** (README.md:101-200) - Organized catalog of 18 commands with practical examples and MCP flag integration
- [ ] **Add security analysis showcase** (README.md:201-250) - Demonstrate OWASP Top 10 coverage using actual test_codebase vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Include advanced features documentation** (README.md:251-300) - MCP tools integration, Python automation architecture, cross-platform support
- [ ] **Add troubleshooting and support section** (README.md:301-350) - Common issues, log files, skip options, and recovery procedures
- [ ] **Create development and contribution guidelines** (README.md:351-400) - Project structure, customization options, and technical architecture
- [ ] **Add badges and project metadata** (README.md:1-10) - GitHub badges for status, version, license, and platform compatibility
- [ ] **Include performance and scaling information** (README.md:400-430) - Enterprise readiness, quality gates, and production deployment notes
- [ ] **Automated test**: Verify all installation commands and examples work as documented
- [ ] **User test**: Review README for clarity, completeness, and developer appeal
