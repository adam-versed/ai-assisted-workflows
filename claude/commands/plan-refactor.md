# Plan Refactor Command

**Mindset**: "Improve without breaking" - Strategic technical debt reduction and modernization planning.

## Behavior
Comprehensive refactoring strategy for technical debt reduction, code modernization, and maintainability improvement with risk mitigation.

### Refactoring Planning Strategy
- **Technical Debt Assessment**: Code quality evaluation and debt prioritization
- **Migration Strategy**: Step-by-step modernization approach with risk analysis
- **Rollback Planning**: Safety measures and contingency procedures
- **Performance Impact**: Performance evaluation and optimization opportunities
- **Team Coordination**: Milestone planning and knowledge transfer strategy
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive testing approach for refactored components

## Refactoring Framework (Assessment 30% | Strategy 25% | Planning 25% | Validation 20%)

### Technical Debt Assessment
- **Code Quality Analysis**: Complexity metrics, code smells, and maintainability issues
- **Architecture Debt**: Design pattern violations and structural improvements needed
- **Performance Debt**: Bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- **Security Debt**: Outdated security practices and vulnerability remediation

### Migration Strategy
- **Refactoring Approach**: Big-bang vs incremental refactoring strategy
- **Priority Framework**: Business impact vs implementation effort analysis
- **Risk Assessment**: Technical risks, business risks, and mitigation strategies
- **Timeline Planning**: Phased implementation with milestone definition

### Implementation Planning
- **Change Management**: Version control, branching, and integration strategy
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests, integration tests, and regression validation
- **Deployment Strategy**: Blue-green deployment, canary releases, and rollback procedures
- **Monitoring Strategy**: Metrics and alerts for refactoring impact assessment

### Validation Planning
- **Quality Gates**: Code quality standards and acceptance criteria
- **Performance Validation**: Before/after performance comparison framework
- **Functional Validation**: Feature parity and regression prevention
- **User Impact Assessment**: User experience and business continuity validation

## Optional Flags
--c7: Use to find proven refactoring patterns for your specific technical debt type (e.g., strangler fig pattern for legacy system migration, module federation for monolith decomposition)
--seq: Use for large refactoring efforts - structures the process: 'assess technical debt and priorities', 'plan migration strategy and phases', 'define testing approach and safety nets', 'create rollback plans', 'establish success metrics and monitoring'

## Refactoring Areas
Code Quality, Performance, Maintainability, Security, Testing, Documentation

## Output Requirements
- Technical debt assessment with prioritized improvement opportunities
- Migration strategy with risk analysis and mitigation plans
- Implementation roadmap with milestones and dependencies
- Testing and validation strategy for refactored components
