# Create Make-Based Development System
**Status:** Done
**Agent PID:** 48438

## Original Todo
we need to work out the best way to create a command(s) that will, for each project we run the command in, replicate the make system shown in wip-workflows/make-dev1.png. Essentially it uses a combination of make commands, procifles and watchexec tool to control server start, server automatic recompile on file change where not already supported and also a capture of component (frontend, backend) events to a central dev.log which you can access the tail from through another make command through any terminal instance running claude code within a given project (dev.log is per project). Supporting files in wip-workflows folder:
  video transcript - make-dev-notes.md (all commentary on this subject is in first 3rd of video)

## Description
A make-based development monitoring system that provides standardized development workflow across any project type. The system uses make targets, Procfiles, and optional watchexec to provide Claude with reliable access to unified development logs. Two implementations exist: a Python script (setup_make_dev.py) for Turborepo projects and an LLM-driven command (setup-dev-monitoring.md) for flexible project support.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Create `claude/commands/setup-dev-monitoring.md` command file (renamed from setup-make-dev.md)
- [x] Create Python script `setup_make_dev.py` for automated Turborepo setup
- [x] Fix LLM command to properly detect and use actual frontend/backend start commands instead of placeholders
- [x] Exclude documentation and log files from watch patterns (only watch source code)
- [x] Allow projects with no custom watch requirements (rely on framework hot-reload)
- [x] Fix script discovery to use relative paths from .claude directory or include ~/.claude in glob search
- [x] Improve dependency check to skip reinstallation if already present
- [x] Add validation to ensure Procfile contains actual runnable commands, not placeholders
- [x] Fix /dev.log read-only file system error by using proper path (./dev.log)
- [x] Ensure frontend and backend components always output to log even without custom watches
- [x] Fix install script to preserve custom scripts in target directory during updates
- [x] Fix MCP tool installation errors in update mode

## Notes
**Current State:**
- Python script `setup_make_dev.py` works correctly for Turborepo projects (see dev-monitor-files/v1)
- LLM command `setup-dev-monitoring.md` has issues (see dev-monitor-files/v2 failure)

**Issues Found:**
1. **Placeholder Commands**: LLM generated `echo "No start command defined"` instead of actual commands like `npm run dev`
2. **Script Path Resolution**: Command looks for scripts in project directory instead of ~/.claude/ directory
3. **Watch Pattern Overreach**: Tries to watch documentation/logs instead of just source code
4. **File System Error**: Uses `/dev.log` (read-only) instead of `./dev.log` 
5. **Dependency Reinstallation**: Doesn't properly detect existing installations
6. **No Validation**: Doesn't verify that generated Procfile has runnable commands

**Working Example (v1):**
```
web: cd apps/web && PORT=3000 npm run dev 2>&1 | while IFS= read -r line; do echo "[$(date '+%H:%M:%S')] [WEB] $line"; done | tee -a ../../dev.log
backend: npm run setup --workspace packages/backend 2>&1 | while IFS= read -r line; do echo "[$(date '+%H:%M:%S')] [BACKEND] $line"; done | tee -a dev.log
```

**Failed Example (v2):**
```  
frontend: PORT=3000 echo "No start command defined" 2>&1 | while IFS= read -r line; do echo "[$(date '+%H:%M:%S')] [FRONTEND] $line"; done
backend: PORT=8000 echo "No start command defined" 2>&1 | while IFS= read -r line; do echo "[$(date '+%H:%M:%S')] [BACKEND] $line"; done
```
