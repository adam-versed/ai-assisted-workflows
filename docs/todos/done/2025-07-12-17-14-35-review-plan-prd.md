## Description
Review plan-prd.md to determine if it fits in a developer-focused automation system. The command creates Product Requirements Documents with market analysis, business strategy, and product management workflows - which may be outside the scope of technical development automation.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Read and analyze plan-prd.md structure and purpose
- [x] Evaluate fitness for developer-focused automation system
- [x] Discuss scope mismatch with user (business vs technical focus) 
- [x] User decision: Replace existing plan-prd.md with improved UX-focused workflow from wip-workflows/ux-prd.md
- [x] Replace claude/commands/plan-prd.md with content from wip-workflows/ux-prd.md
- [x] Rename to plan-ux-prd.md to better reflect UX focus
- [x] Update README.md and project-description.md with new command name and description
- [x] User test: Validate final decision addresses scope concerns

- Much better fit for developer-focused automation system
- Renamed to plan-ux-prd.md to clearly indicate UX focus vs generic business PRD
