ok, your prompt, you need to make some small changes:

- we need to introduce a role definition at the top "You are a ..."
- you need to retain the same kid of script_path resolution as found in the security analysis prompt, have it search out the todo-planner folder then all subsequent calls in the script can assume that base location
- you cant assume it will be python3 - thats mac specific - this is multi platform, hence why the security script just refers to python - this whole process will have a dependency installation script ill create later so you can assume python is present.

also lose all the references about network access - you want to approach the online search to gather more context if there are gaps like the #file:plan-solution.md script phase 3 (use as an example of online research, but use a step process suitable to our workflow - dont just copy that solution plan approach), the user verification is getting their approval or selection of what you found and what to carry forward as context.

Run #file:plan-ux-prd.md to help us come up with a product idea around assessing landing pages conversion effectiveness for sales/user sign up for a product or service. We need a way to leverage a hybrid approach of LLM analysis with programmatic scripts to come up with a repeatable consistent scoring framework that grads the proposition and then can offer advice on how to improve their score/conversion rate. I also like the idea of there being a league table of sites that are public that the process has gone off and analysed and reported back, which helps people to learn about what is good and bad - this could be the free element on the site. I see it being a web app which has this league table, with a user area where they can schedule analysis of their own product and get analysis and advice back + a behind the scenes job processing that goes and performs programmatic analysis + a some kind of LLM process to interpret some elements of it and reports back to the user with advice.

Im very open to ideas on how best to approach this, so initially review all the items in this folder /Users/adamjackson/LocalDev/visual-design-system and then lets go through our initial qustion and research phase to see what pain points / best platform approach would be.

### Message 6

**Type:** unknown

try access that visua-design-system folder ive now attached, that contains all the docs I want you to review which includes an initial prompt for assessing landing pages

### Message 7

**Type:** unknown

please use brave-search mcp tool to perform the websearch around problem space and user pain points the prompt asks for

---

### Message 8

**Type:** unknown

just rerun the searches first - we are still in research and question mode. For the scoring mechanism to be consistent we should break the criteria into categories and regardless of those criteria the category is either a pass or a fail (pass = 1 point) - this would seem to be the safest way to keep non deterministic LLM give a consistent score, which improves as all items within a category are addressed. We also need to gamify that process in some way, something that pushes on the need for a complete and perfect score, the neatness of seeing everything within a categoy positive.

---

### Message 9

**Type:** unknown

First list to me all the outstanding questions you have asked me that i havent addressed - so i can run through them all now

### Message 10

**Type:** unknown

primary user - solo founders and content creators trying to sell products, newsletters signups, training courses etc.
v1 scope - on-deman + scheduled scans
Compliance - what do you mean here? We arent looking to capture their data and keep it, we are just reviewing the layout, design and content effectiveness at the conversion goal
v1 success kpi: what wau? scans per day seem right as that will mean user growth and purchase
alternatives - dont know, use brave search to find out
target site - saas and lead-gen (email sign ups)
LLM budget - lets start with a SOTA model to get process setup, but then we need to use an EVAl and explore what combination of models gets our cost per scan as low as possible - we should also try and leverage programmatic scripts as much as possible for the process - minimising the LLM usage - the LLM is probably most about offering advice on improvements based around rule sets we use for analysis.
tone - i leave that up to your research, think of the gamifying aspect though
accessbility - wcag 2.2 is fine, device emphasis, where market research suggests
screen architecture - let your market and user research decide
design standards - let your market and user research decide
onboarding + pricing - have the them go straight into a scan a url with the top 2 issues reported back, but the rest of the report blurred out, along with the improvement advice - im not sure how quick we can make this process though so we need some way of keeping them around to wait - with any additional scans you can use the scheduling system and let them go off and do what they want and be notified when ready (as they will already be a paid subscriber)
league ethics - lets not worry about this for now, im not sure it will be a problem, but we can put it as a future improvement if that proves not to be the case
stack - depends on what you have in mind, but i do have a cloudflare account and do like the workers you can setup there, but s3 is probabably cheapest for the storage element (do we have anything assets store?) - I think convexdb is worth considering for process / backend etc as they have a generous free tier. I would also like posthog included for analysis, including user actions and errors, again, has a generous free tier.
Operations - im unclear how the process will happen at the moment, but we want to make the process as unintrusive as possible vs balanced with speed. Policy wise, i need a better understanding of our approach - im inclined to not store anything we dont have to, i.e. capture what we need, analyse and report - but that may not be possible.
The scoring model should follow a combination of the research docs I shared and the elements they mention as factors as this was a convergence of various best practices from a range of actors, combined with your own searches..

I thnk those scoring categories are far too limited - see the attached prompt - this is what we shoudl be exploring, I dont see why we include SEO - that would be for attracting visitors to the site, we arent assessing this, we are focusing on when their is a visitor, will they convert. I think we need to make deterministic/consistent version of the attached prompt

### Message 13

**Type:** unknown

there are still LLM analysis parts to this scoring mechanism, like how compelling the content is to the target audience, psychological triggers etc - so we still need some llm analysis, but we offset the the non deterministic process by a category being pass or fail (1 point) as opposed to attributing a score.

---

### Message 14

**Type:** unknown

so just talk me through a hypothetical flow of process from a user submitting a url to analysis to reporting - so i can understand what you are proposing e2e

---

### Message 15

**Type:** unknown

i dont want the user to see the fact there is a queue and their position, we can just say we will notify you when your report is ready - i think it will make the user feel frustrate or less valued if they see themselves in a queue.

---

### Message 16

**Type:** unknown

you can proceed with writing the prd now

---

### Message 17

**Type:** unknown

I do wnat you to create both of those, but first we need to consider how the submit-first ux is open to abuse, they should require a sign up as the first step before they can submit a url and there should be a universal rule of only 1 free scan per url (globally, not restricted to user)

---

### Message 18

**Type:** unknown

just to expand on the abuse prevention it should be 1 free scan per site and but also 1 free scan per user - that prevents multiple abuse vectors.

---

### Message 19

**Type:** unknown

Review the attached prd - ensure we have stack profiles and jinja templates that would cover all the elements of the tech stack choices in that prd.

---

### Message 20

**Type:** unknown

some observations on your templates so far:

- if you look at things like #file:api-route.jinja its more of a template, theres recognition of possible implementations and no content specific to a particular implementation
- if you compare to the one in nextjs-workers-convex, thats really poor template, i does the opposite of the above.
- also why are duplicating templates, there should not be multiple api-route.jinga - i feel you are making the stack profiles to broad like nextjs-app-router makes sense, but as it already exists you should have created nextjs-workers-convex, you have comflated to much, I would have used the original nextjs-app-router, a new stack labelled cloudflare-workers and another new stack labelled convexdb

### Message 21

Analyze this shared/todo-planner project and its #file:README.md build up context of what the project is, how it works and the different components to it. You dont need to explore outside of that folder (but do explore its sub directories).

---

### Message 22

**Type:** unknown

I want to query part of the system, the jinja templates - I'm not sure how effective these are - given we are trying to use these to guide best practices for a particularly technology implementation, but through file creation with method stubs - im not sure these templates have enough detail to be useful for that best practice guidance? Lets discuss strengths, weaknesses and options (dont change anything)

---

### Message 23

**Type:** unknown

the best practice rules / advice partials should offer guidance on what to do if that particular option is required for that particular implementation - what to follow should still be a choice for the implementing LLM, but we should define the rules for how to follow when that choice is made.

---

### Message 24

**Type:** unknown

I was thinking of something simpler than that, you seem to be implying creating jinja templates on the fly? I figured prd implies a certain feature > llm has decided on the approach > llm finds the appropriate stack label and underlying jinja template > jinja template contains non optional and optional guidance on how to implement different aspects/patterns when implementing that template into an instance.

Now, im not experienced with jinja so I dont know if the above is possible, i.e. are you allowed to have optional elements to a template that might not get used at point of creating an instance. Lets have a bit of discussion around this premise first before you go off and define the whole e2e solution of whats being chatted about.

---

### Message 25

**Type:** unknown

yes implement a single example please and then walk me through how it would be used with a real use case and what the expected instance would look like - you can pick a feature from the attached prd

---

### Message 26

**Type:** unknown

yes, simulate through dry run and show me the full rendered file

---

### Message 27

**Type:** unknown

tidy up any impermenant or test scaffolding you just added for this example.

Lets move on to rolling out this approach in our planner system - will your tasks include a rubric to check quality of templates?

---

### Message 28

**Type:** unknown

that sounds fine, ensure you have rolled out template support for all the text oulined in the example prd - and ensure we use singular focus for a our stack labels - i dont want to see any nextjs-worker-convex combinations and if any of the current code around creating those needs to have its rules adjust to support this include that in your roll out.

---

### Message 29

**Type:** unknown

that fine to continue but i have an observation - given this planner system needs to be agnostic of the calling project prd, node-scripts/ folder and its contents doesnt seem right to me i.e. there should be no axe-runner.jinja, lighthouse-runner.jinja etc there should be a nodejs.jinja right?

---

### Message 30

**Type:** unknown

i dont think there should be an option for those specific tools, unless you are using them as an example, we should just cover how you implement code within that nodejs jinja - so presumable syntax usage, function usage etc - is that correct>

---

### Message 31

**Type:** unknown

dont keep legacy mappings, we are iterating our approach - this should be true of all our code - we should not be holding on to legacy code if we have determined an improved approach

---

### Message 32

no more dry run, run the full process on the #file:landing-conversion-scorer-prd.md

dont update the normalize.py - we should be running this test from our prompt, which will go through the process of capturing all this information. Give me instructions on how to run this and ill action it myself in another chat. However i want you to create notes of what we have done in this session to update #file:session-notes.md

### Message 35

I want you to stop the current tasks and write out a log of events to planner-run-001.md

---

### Message 36

**Type:** unknown

we need to make some improvements to #file:plan-implementation-skeleton.md we need its initial information gathering and context analysis follow the approach used in #file:plan-ux-prd.md phase 1, it should assess whether the user has supplied enough information it their opening request to address the questions, follow up with targetted questions and perform research when theres gaps - then finish with playing back agreed findings before continuing with the rest of the prd generation process.

---

### Message 37

**Type:** unknown

Review #file:CLAUDE.md and #file:README.md and #file:session-notes.md and then I want you to review and critique the #file:implementation-plan.md I have created.

---

### Message 38

**Type:** unknown

if you review #file:README.md and #file:CLAUDE.md you will see two different system approaches to build complete production systems. If you review #file:llm-code-assist.md blog article about where the current code assist shifts the focus of assisted effort, with that and #file:theo.md commentary on that blog post (ignore the transcript notes about augment code as thats an advert) - they establish:

- that product development requires an understanding of context, of users, decisions and solutions to support
- that agentic coding lessens your ability to understand tech choices and approaches underpinning the solution choices
- that situation is fine for throwaway prototypes, but is not what you want from production systems, otherwise it can lead to problems (perf, security, what features actually delivery) further down the line.

I want to explore how we can introduce some kind of new paradigm on paired programming which is some sort of evolution of auto suggest. Can we start with an agree high level feature list and understanding of the user flow - so function, ux and visual design - assume the developer creates the base project in tandem with the llm (I already have this setup as a process in #create-project.md) but I want to explore what we can take from the learnings above and then create this new kind of paired approach to the feature development that allows a developer to still build awareness of what is happening and decisions made (and have some control over those) and so retained that contextual knowledge i mentioned above but with the speed of an llm implementing the code. I almost see it as like an LLM chat conversation thats been prompted to have the correct level of interaction points but more interactive and interesting so it should feel like both are creating the page together much like you see with autosuggest - so it might be:

- feature choice - i would say this is the user selecting from the feature list and this is how this paired approach is initialised
- llm gathers context - it should gather detail to understand what choices are already know and should be applied for this task, i.e. we are in a next js project, nothign is currently built so logically we should start with a layout.tsx, or we are working to tdd so first i start with creating a failing unit test (which the user can overrule and suggest alternative)
- llm creates initial skeleteon using jinja template (taken from our learnings from previous approach)
- paired session - we move into the skeleton and see greyed out choices that the user can move over quickly using keyboard navigation, which they can either confirm (choice is solidified, move next) or iterate over any part of it to make changes (resulting in solidified, move next)
- all artifact choices made, trigger quality check/lint, LLM can make revisions (user oversees)
- artifact complete, move to next task item
- loop through this approach until tasks are complete, this loop will also include debug runs, including previewing work so far.

I want you to analyse all this information and suggest:

- the task loop with all stages and what should happen that would cover all facets of a feature development task
- what approaches do we have to implement this as a user experience, given our goals of developer contextual understanding, still involved in the hands on process but benefiting from automation as much as possible without sacrificing contextual understanding.
- what makes sense build this - is it a vs code extension, is its a whole new ide, what makes sense? How could we build a prototype very quickly, with the least effort to test ideas.

Use brave search mcp to perform research, but be mindful of the rate limiting, so stagger your requests.

### Message 39

**Type:** unknown

we should also look for the system to be proactive - so for example, obvious things i can see from your workflow:

- the gathered context doesnt need to happen every task, if we move on to the next task within the same project, unless we are introducing a new capability or making an architectural change then that task is already complete
- all skeleton gen can happen for the entire task straight away and the developer can start working on the first item whilst this carries on in the background, and as things are created should be able to quickly move between implementations.
- as hes tabbing or clicking through the different skeleton items to approve/edit he should have autosuggest available, which includes a catalog of existing classes and functions within them to select from as well as standard context sensitive coding options for the current scenario.
- shouldnt have to wait for quality gates on a review item before moving next item, they should be background tasks that the LLM can handle and only flag if changes have been made that impact coding intention i.e. if its spacing or strongly typing it can action, if its change the purpose of a function or its arguments, that would need review.

In your what to build commentary, can you outline what actualy is possible from a ux point view when you say 80-90% there, what can and cant we do inline of the page i.e. is some kind of overlay paired with ghosted text possible etc.
