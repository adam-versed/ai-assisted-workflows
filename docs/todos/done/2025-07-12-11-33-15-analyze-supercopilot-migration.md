## Description
Analyze SuperCopilot's GitHub Copilot workflow system and design a migration strategy to Claude Code. SuperCopilot uses a sophisticated switch-based architecture with 4 chat modes (Analyze, Build, Plan, Fix) and specialized switches for different tasks, achieving 97% token efficiency through just-in-time loading. The system combines AI workflows with automated Python scripts for comprehensive analysis and includes universal tools for git commits, documentation research, and complex problem solving.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Document SuperCopilot's architecture and command patterns (supercopilot/ directory analysis)
- [x] Present high-level mapping strategy to user for feedback
- [x] Map SuperCopilot modes to Claude Code command equivalents
- [x] Design command structure with switch-to-flag migration
- [x] Create token optimization strategy leveraging Claude Code's MCP tools
- [x] Design scriptable analysis integration using Bash tool
- [x] Create migration implementation plan with specific command examples
- [x] Document enhanced capabilities possible with Claude Code's tool ecosystem
- [x] User test: Review migration plan and command mapping strategy

## Notes
- SuperCopilot repo cloned at commit 5156e7b94f2e6c5e024bc318e088dd99c63526fc
- Comprehensive analysis completed of 4 chat modes, switch system, and Python automation
- Claude Code research shows superior tool ecosystem and workflow management capabilities
- Implementation completed: claude/ directory created with commands/ and scripts/ 
- SuperCopilot scripts copied to claude/scripts/ maintaining original structure
- Core command files created: security-review, performance-audit, build-feature, debug-issue, architecture-review, quick-prototype
- Commands integrate automated scripts with Claude Code MCP tools (--c7, --seq, --magic, --browser)
