# Security Review Command

**Mindset**: "What could go wrong?" - Combine automated scanning with contextual threat assessment.

## Behavior
Comprehensive security analysis using OWASP Top 10 framework with automated script integration and contextual threat assessment.

### Automated Security Checks (OWASP Top 10 Coverage)
Execute security analysis scripts via Bash tool for measurable vulnerability detection:
```bash
# Secret detection and vulnerability scanning
python claude/scripts/analyze/security/detect_secrets.py --target . --format json
python claude/scripts/analyze/security/scan_vulnerabilities.py --target . --format json  
python claude/scripts/analyze/security/check_auth.py --target . --format json
python claude/scripts/analyze/security/validate_inputs.py --target . --format json
```

## Script Capabilities (OWASP Top 10 Coverage)
- **scan_vulnerabilities.py**: Detects OWASP A01 (Injection - SQL, Command, LDAP, XPath) and A03 (XSS - Reflected, Stored)
- **validate_inputs.py**: Comprehensive injection detection covering SQL, NoSQL, Command, Path Traversal, and LDAP injection patterns
- **check_auth.py**: Covers OWASP A07 (Authentication Failures) including weak passwords, session fixation, missing CSRF
- **detect_secrets.py**: Identifies hardcoded credentials and API keys (supports OWASP A02 - Cryptographic Failures)

### Contextual Security Assessment
- **Business Logic Security**: Evaluate authorization rules for privilege escalation risks
- **Architecture Security Review**: Assess defense-in-depth implementation and control effectiveness
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify assets, threats, vulnerabilities in business context
- **Data Flow Security**: Analyze security between components and external interfaces

## Analysis Process
1. **Run scripts** to identify measurable security issues
2. **Analyze outputs** in context of business requirements  
3. **Evaluate risks** through architectural review
4. **Prioritize findings** by business impact and exploitability
5. **Generate report** combining automated + contextual analysis

## Optional Flags
--c7: Use when you need to verify your security implementations against current OWASP Top 10 guidelines and framework-specific security patterns (e.g., Django CSRF middleware configuration, Express.js helmet security headers)
--seq: Use for comprehensive security audits - systematically breaks down the analysis into OWASP Top 10 categories with specific steps like 'A01: scan for injection vulnerabilities', 'A02: check authentication failures', 'A03: validate data exposure'

## Risk Assessment Levels
- **CRITICAL**: Data breach, system compromise, compliance violation
- **HIGH**: Privilege escalation, injection, auth bypass
- **MEDIUM**: Information disclosure, DoS, config issues  
- **LOW**: Hardening opportunities, defense gaps

## Output Requirements
- Risk-rated vulnerability report with script outputs
- Contextual analysis with business impact assessment
- Prioritized remediation roadmap with implementation guidance
- Code examples and security control recommendations
