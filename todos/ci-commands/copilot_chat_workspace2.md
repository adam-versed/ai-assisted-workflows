I want you to review this analysis #file:planning-workflow.md of the python planning documentation creation app thats located in todos/prps-agentic-eng.

You will note a comprehensive approach to creating task documentation and then execution of that plan to create a project.

Focusing on the task plan creation elementing I want to look at learning from its approach to create a workflow that will take an existing prd (like one created by #plan-ux-prd.md - a more ux focused prd approach) and any other accompanying docs you might supply, like high level solution design including things like tech stack - and use those items to create a task plan that uses the approach from the prps-agentic-eng project. What I like about it is that:

- maps out the target project structure right down to individual file level
- it produces the complete implementation code for each file

This leaves no room for hallucination or duplicate functions because everything is mapped out, including how functions are called and used across multiple components, rather than the usual issue you have with code assist generation where you see the same function created from scratch over and over with no reuse.

However, I think this approach could be made more efficient, I think create the full project structure, down to specific filenames is correct, but I think you could just stub out the functions and comment within each file rather than writing the whole function code - this would allow good solution design following dry/solid principles, but the advantage would be you arent spending token usage costs on a task that would be repeated at the point of a code assist implementing the body of the functions.

I also like what looks to be the use of coding templates in conjunction with a programmatic implementation approach with python? I was wondering if we could maybe look at something like jinja as a way of handling a specifc projects technology implementation and ensure it adheres to a coding template for that language we want it to use https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/ - whether this would be templates we create and supply / reference as part of the task plan, or when we create our granular project structure we create the files with functional stubs using this approach, I am unsure.

Consider all these points, do some analysis of your own and lets discuss how we will approach creating a new task planning workflow - once we have agreed that plan we can action it.

that sounds good, I would suggest the initial workflow has a starting section to review the context thats been supplied about the project and determines whether it meets minimum threshold to start planning, or whether it needs to ask the user questions (first choice for gaps) and finally fall back to online search, with user verification of findings as a fall back for handling gaps blocking start planning. I dont want you to create this in the claude-code/commands folder create this in shared/todo-planner

so thats a good start, but I was thinking making this a hybrid of prompt + programmatic workflow, so a prompt as the whole workflow orchestrator, which would include an initial phase of gathering context, which you currently have as normalize. I guess this is a departure from your cli.py right - you were making this a command line tool? If you want to see an example of a hybrid approach check #file:analyze-security.md - this would mean much more nuance in how it could handle initial context gathering and the fall back search mechanism (use the models native online search capabilities) to fill out the context - before handing over to the more deterministic scripts for the rest of the process.

ok, your prompt, you need to make some small changes:

- we need to introduce a role definition at the top "You are a ..."
- you need to retain the same kid of script_path resolution as found in the security analysis prompt, have it search out the todo-planner folder then all subsequent calls in the script can assume that base location
- you cant assume it will be python3 - thats mac specific - this is multi platform, hence why the security script just refers to python - this whole process will have a dependency installation script ill create later so you can assume python is present.

also lose all the references about network access - you want to approach the online search to gather more context if there are gaps like the #file:plan-solution.md script phase 3 (use as an example of online research, but use a step process suitable to our workflow - dont just copy that solution plan approach), the user verification is getting their approval or selection of what you found and what to carry forward as context.

Im happy with your plan, feel free to implement this task planner up to your complete intended solution

Run #file:plan-ux-prd.md to help us come up with a product idea around assessing landing pages conversion effectiveness for sales/user sign up for a product or service. We need a way to leverage a hybrid approach of LLM analysis with programmatic scripts to come up with a repeatable consistent scoring framework that grads the proposition and then can offer advice on how to improve their score/conversion rate. I also like the idea of there being a league table of sites that are public that the process has gone off and analysed and reported back, which helps people to learn about what is good and bad - this could be the free element on the site. I see it being a web app which has this league table, with a user area where they can schedule analysis of their own product and get analysis and advice back + a behind the scenes job processing that goes and performs programmatic analysis + a some kind of LLM process to interpret some elements of it and reports back to the user with advice.

Im very open to ideas on how best to approach this, so initially review all the items in this folder /Users/adamjackson/LocalDev/visual-design-system and then lets go through our initial qustion and research phase to see what pain points / best platform approach would be.
