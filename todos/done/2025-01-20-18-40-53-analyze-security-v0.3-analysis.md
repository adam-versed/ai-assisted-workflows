## Analysis Report for analyze-security.md v0.3 Update

### Current State Analysis of analyze-security.md v0.2

#### Version and Core Philosophy
- **Version**: v0.2 (clearly marked)
- **Core Philosophy**: "What could go wrong?" - Combines automated scanning with contextual threat assessment
- **Framework**: OWASP Top 10 based security analysis

#### Current Workflow Structure
The file follows a hybrid approach with three main components:
1. **Automated Security Checks** (Lines 9-34)
2. **Contextual Security Assessment** (Lines 35-41) 
3. **Security Coverage Gap Assessment & Autonomous Action** (Lines 42-137)

#### Strengths of Current Approach
1. **Comprehensive OWASP Coverage**: Maps scripts to specific OWASP Top 10 categories (A01-A10)
2. **Hybrid Detection Model**: Combines automated scripts with LLM contextual analysis
3. **Gap Assessment Framework**: Systematic approach to identify coverage gaps between scripts and reality
4. **Technology-Specific Analysis**: Acknowledges framework-specific security requirements
5. **Autonomous Search Patterns**: Detailed regex patterns for each OWASP category (lines 94-130)
6. **Flexible Output Modes**: Default vs. verbose mode with different detail levels
7. **Risk Prioritization**: Clear severity levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)

#### Identified Weaknesses and Bloat
1. **Symbol Legend Redundancy** (Lines 197-206):
   - Contains 6 symbols (ü§ñ üß† üîç üö® ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚úÖ üìã) 
   - May be unnecessarily complex for practical use
   - Could conflict with severity levels which serve similar purpose

2. **Verbose Implementation Details**:
   - Extensive regex patterns (lines 97-130) make the document heavy
   - Too much technical implementation detail in a command specification
   - Script location process is overly detailed (lines 23-26)

3. **Inconsistent Output Requirements**:
   - Default mode has complex requirements (lines 172-186)
   - Verbose mode overlaps significantly with default (lines 187-195)
   - Gap analysis table visibility rules are confusing

4. **Process Complexity**:
   - Three-phase autonomous action system (3A, 3B, 3C) may be overly complex
   - Mixed responsibilities between automated and manual analysis

### Key Programmatic Patterns from plan-refactor.md v0.3

#### Header Structure Pattern
```markdown
# analyze-security v0.3

**Mindset**: "What could go wrong?" - Strategic security analysis through automated scanning, contextual threat assessment, and comprehensive OWASP coverage.

## Workflow Process
```

#### Phase Structure with Numbered Steps
```markdown
### Phase 1: Automated Security Assessment

1. **Execute automated security scripts** - Run comprehensive vulnerability detection
   ```bash
   # Note: LLM must locate script installation directory dynamically using Glob tool
   # Scripts may be in project-level .claude/ or user-level ~/.claude/ directories
   python [SCRIPT_PATH]/detect_secrets.py . --output-format json
   python [SCRIPT_PATH]/scan_vulnerabilities.py . --output-format json
   python [SCRIPT_PATH]/check_auth.py . --output-format json
   python [SCRIPT_PATH]/validate_inputs.py . --output-format json
   ```

2. **Analyze script outputs** - Process automated findings against OWASP Top 10

3. **Generate initial security baseline** - Compile automated results for contextual analysis
```

#### STOP Interactions for User Input
```markdown
**STOP** ‚Üí "Automated security analysis complete. Proceed with gap assessment? (y/n)"
```

#### Quality Gates Validation
```markdown
2. **Quality Gates Validation**
   - [ ] All OWASP Top 10 categories systematically assessed
   - [ ] Script outputs validated against codebase architecture
   - [ ] Technology-specific security patterns identified
   - [ ] Business logic vulnerabilities evaluated
   - [ ] Security findings prioritized by business impact
```

### Recommended v0.3 Transformation

#### Phase Structure Should Be:
1. **Phase 1: Automated Security Assessment** (scripts + initial analysis)
2. **Phase 2: Gap Assessment and Contextual Analysis** (OWASP coverage + business logic)
3. **Phase 3: Risk Prioritization and Reporting** (findings + remediation roadmap)
4. **Phase 4: Quality Validation and Task Transfer** (validation + todos.md)

#### Key Reductions Needed:
- Remove verbose "Required Autonomous Search Patterns" section (lines 94-131)
- Simplify verbose mode explanation (lines 139-196)
- Reduce symbol legend to essential items or eliminate entirely
- Move detailed grep patterns to execution phase instructions
- Consolidate output format explanations
- Reduce from 208 lines to approximately 110-120 lines

#### Essential Elements to Preserve:
- OWASP Top 10 systematic coverage
- Script integration with glob-based discovery
- Gap assessment between automated and manual analysis
- Business context evaluation
- Technology-specific security patterns
- Risk prioritization framework

#### Task Transfer Format for todos.md:
