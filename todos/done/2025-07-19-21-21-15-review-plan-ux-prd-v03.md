# Review plan-ux-prd.md with programmatic-prompt-commandfile.md approach and create v0.3
**Status:** Done
**Agent PID:** 40202

## Original Todo
review plan-ux-prd.md with the programmatic-prompt-commandfile.md approach and create a new version iterated to v0.3

## Description
Update plan-ux-prd.md from v0.2 to v0.3 by applying the programmatic-prompt-commandfile.md methodology. The review will enhance the existing comprehensive PRD creation command by improving phase structure clarity, adding quality gates for validation, and ensuring full compliance with the established programmatic prompt workflow rules while maintaining the robust UX/product management capabilities.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Read current plan-ux-prd.md v0.2 - Analyze existing structure and content (claude/commands/plan-ux-prd.md)
- [x] Apply programmatic prompt methodology - Restructure phases with numbered steps, improve clarity, add quality gates
- [x] Update version only - Change version from v0.2 to v0.3 (keep existing behavior description unchanged)
- [x] Enhance phase structure - Convert existing workflow to numbered steps following programmatic prompt rules
- [x] Add quality validation gates - Include PRD completeness checkpoints and validation steps
- [x] Standardize user interactions - Optimize STOP markers and confirmation points
- [x] Validate against command patterns - Ensure consistency with existing command ecosystem
- [x] Create Python PRD template generator script - Build script that generates PRD from JSON arguments
- [x] Test workflow structure - Verify logical flow and completeness of updated command
- [x] Update install.sh to include new scripts and command files
- [x] Add Phase 7 to setup-dev-monitoring.md for CLAUDE.md integration
- [x] Create update_claude_md.py script for adding development workflow commands

## Notes
Added missing Phase 7 to setup-dev-monitoring.md that integrates development workflow commands into project CLAUDE.md. This ensures make-based workflow restrictions and commands are properly documented in each project.
