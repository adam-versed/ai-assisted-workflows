# security workflow enhancement - assess script objectives vs codebase reality

**Status:** In Progress
**Started:** 2025-07-13T17:07:18
**Agent PID:** 36629

## Description
Enhance the security workflow by adding a new assessment phase that identifies gaps in security script coverage and then automatically performs additional LLM-driven security actions to fill those gaps. The current security workflow executes 4 automated scripts, but these generic scripts may miss context-specific security issues. This enhancement will add a "Security Coverage Gap Assessment & Action" phase where the LLM first evaluates if the executed scripts adequately address the security landscape of the specific codebase, then automatically performs its own complementary security analysis to cover any identified gaps.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Read current analyze-security.md workflow structure (analyze-security.md)
- [x] Insert new "Security Coverage Gap Assessment & Autonomous Action" phase after step 2 (analyze-security.md:32)
- [x] Renumber existing analysis process steps 3-5 to become 4-6 (analyze-security.md)
- [x] Add gap assessment symbol üîç to Symbol Legend section (analyze-security.md)
- [x] Update output requirements to include autonomous analysis results (analyze-security.md)
- [x] Add detailed LLM instructions for autonomous security actions (analyze-security.md)
- [x] Automated test: Verify workflow markdown structure is valid after modifications
- [x] Automated test: Test workflow with sample codebase to ensure gap assessment functions
- [x] Automated test: Verify all workflow steps are properly numbered and referenced
- [x] User test: Run /analyze-security on test codebase and verify new gap assessment phase executes
- [x] User test: Confirm LLM performs autonomous security actions beyond script outputs  
- [x] User test: Verify enhanced security findings include both script and autonomous analysis

## Notes
File modifications completed successfully. The analyze-security.md workflow now includes:
- New phase 3: "Security Coverage Gap Assessment & Autonomous Action"
- Detailed gap assessment instructions (Phase 3A, 3B, 3C)
- Updated symbol legend with üîç and üìã symbols
- Enhanced output requirements including autonomous analysis results
- Properly renumbered analysis process steps (1-6)

## Original Todo
- security workflow enhancement, add a new phase that assesses the scripts objectives and approach against the code implementation you are assessing and understand if there are any gaps in the security assessment and plan and carry out your own set of actions to compliment the process. This enhancement is specific to the security workflow, but i think adding such a phase (understanding workflow intentions vs reality of the codebase resulting in possible gaps to cover) should be potentially added to each workflow in teh analyze commands.
